When updating the OpenSilver version, make sure to:
- Update the OpenSilver Dependency version in the nuspec
- Make sure the js/css files in the location used to generate the package are of the same version as the referenced OpenSilver version
- Update the OpenSilver reference in the OpenSilver.Blazor project.
- Hopefully, I didn't forget anything :)
